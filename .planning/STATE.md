## Decisions Log

| Date | Decision | Why |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-05-04 | Static SPA architecture, no backend (durable) | Existing repo design; documented in `.planning/codebase/ARCHITECTURE.md` |
| 2026-05-04 | North star reframed: "Manager out of the loop" | Customer-validated by Ben Bertsche 2026-05-01 |
| 2026-05-04 | AI Scope-Review tool deferred to v3 | Sibling tool surface, milestone-sized, possibly forces a backend conversation |
| 2026-05-04 | Manager hour-estimator spreadsheets out of scope as training inputs (durable) | Customer deliberate exclusion; data should drive, not crude heuristics |
| 2026-05-04 | Per-phase research disabled by default in `config.json` | Codebase map + customer feedback already provide richer context than research could; flip on per-phase as needed |
| 2026-05-04 | YOLO mode + coarse granularity | Single-dev iteration; auto-advance through approval gates that don't need fresh thought |
| ⏳ pending | Quote persistence: browser-only vs introduce a backend | Decision deferred to v2 milestone discuss-phase |

## Notes for Future Sessions

- The runtime hook ("no master dataset / 409") is **stale for this repo**. It describes parent-app behavior. Treat it as informational. See memory `project_static_demo_no_backend.md`.
- Specialist agents for backend/auth/storage **do not apply** to this repo. Use `frontend-specialist`, `ui-ux-specialist`, `test-writer` only.
- The user prefers plans with concrete code skeletons / exact strings / exact paths (memory `feedback_plan_specificity.md`), and a two-view plan format (memory `feedback_plan_format.md`). Honor both when running `/gsd-plan-phase`.
